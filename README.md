# Haiku Flow

Haiku Flow is a full stack web-based application to help writers overcome creativity blocks by using constraints as a mantel to elevate ideas. Users choose a random word from Word API and use it in a haiku, where users are guided with a syllable counter. Users can delete or save and access their created haikus from a database.
